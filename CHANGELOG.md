# Changelog

## 0.9.1 Disabling configuration client

This release restores the ContainerSSH 0.3 functionality where passing an empty `url` in the configuration would disable fetching configuration from the config server.

## 0.9.0 Initial Release

This is the initial port from ContainerSSH 0.3. It is able to load ContainerSSH 0.3 configuration files, but deprecates the `listen` option in the root configuration and instead moves it to `ssh` â†’ `listen`.
